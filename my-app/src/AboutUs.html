    <p>
        What if you could discover the story behind the artwork around you? This is something we found ourselves wondering. We’ve noticed local artwork and artists have not been getting the attention they deserve -- so we decided to change that. With Face the Art, we wanted to bring generally unknown information about local art and artists to any possible viewers. With a simple tap, we’ve ensured users will have access to curated information on local artists’ and their work, along with an option to support them via donations. We’re proud to endorse and support local artists and their stories, educating the community one tap at a time.
